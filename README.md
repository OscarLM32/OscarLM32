### Altough my time as a gamer dates back to my early years, it is been only for the last 2 years that I have inmersed myself in the vast world of game dev. In this period of time I have enhanced my skills in both development and design, my projects being proof of this improvement.

<h3 align="justify">Although my focus has been set on developing games using C# and Unity, I have developed different programs making use of OOP such as C++ and Java as part of my education.</h3>

# Design Skills
![Figma](https://img.shields.io/badge/figma-%23F24E1E.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=figma&logoColor=white)
![Google Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/GOOGLE%20DOCS-white?style=for-the-badge&logo=google-docs)
![Blender](https://img.shields.io/badge/blender-%23F5792A.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=blender&logoColor=white)

<h3 align="justify">I believe design to be the very core of every videogame, not only gameplay wise but also shaping and defining the development. That is why I always try to keep my designs updated during development.</h3>
<h3 align="justify">
	I mainly use Figma to prototype user interfaces and construct different elements like gameplay-loop diagrams while documenting everything
	making use of Google Docs. My first GDD made for <a href="https://github.com/OscarLM32/Virtual-Fruits">Virtual Fruits</a> can be seen <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lJiy592_JxmwuRkl_hvUobWLtROLymsCWQBHJLBjCwA/edit?usp=sharing">here!</a>
</h3>

<h3>Finally, I have created a series of 3D assets in Blender 3D tat can be check in <a href="https://sketchfab.com/Oscar-Lopez">SketchFab</a>.</h3>
